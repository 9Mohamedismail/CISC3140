# CISC3140 LAB 2
**Hello. The following is how to run each file.**

# MAKEFILE
**``To run the makefile use``** *`make lab2`*
**``You wil be asked to input a javefile name. For this lab type "labTwo``**
**``This will then make an output called "makeFileOutput.txt" that has the results of the Java Program``**

# SAMPLE BASH FILE
**(This calls the bash shell file which holds the functions that run the java program and the daysUntil shell file)**

**``To run the sample.sh use``** *``chmod +x sample.sh && ./sample.sh``*
**``This will run the java program and create a output called "shellOutput.txt" that has the results of the program. It is similar to the makeFileOutput from above``**
**``This program will also output the results of the bash version of the date calculator into the terminal``**

# Script file
**``Because github actions was not implemented, a log file of the terminal has been provided. Please remember that both the make and sample shell file create a output.txt (as requested) so the terminal log doesn't show this.``**
